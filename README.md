# Fork of Obsidian Vim Reading View Navigation

This is a fork of kometenstaub's obsidian vim reading view navigation.

This plugin allows to scroll with <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> in the Reading View.

It also lets you navigate with <kbd>gg</kbd> and <kbd>G</kbd> to the top or bottom of a note. (When embeds are present, you may need to press <kbd>G</kbd> more than once.)

`ctrl+u` and `ctrl+d` scroll 15 linues up/down.

## Configuration

The scroll speed can be configured in the settings.

## Installation

It can be installed manually or via BRAT. It is not in the community plugins.

## Known issues

When the search is open in reading view and edit view is toggled on and off, the search needs to be closed and reopened again for it to work correctly.

## Credits

Thank you to @pjeby for the [monkey-around](https://github.com/pjeby/monkey-around) library which is used for monkey-patching internal methods.
